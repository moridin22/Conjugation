## NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS
# Conjugation

An OSX application for practicing the conjugation of Korean verbs.

## Getting Started
### Installation
The "verbs" application in the [dist](dist) folder should be able to run the application without any installation of python required.
### Usage
Press the **Meaning?** button or the *m* key to display the meaning of the word; press the **Next word** button or the *n* key to go on to the next word.

##Current Issues
The application not display the correct answer; this application is not for learning how to conjugate, but rather to practice increasing conjugation speed.

Also, there is currently no method for the user to select which tenses to practice.
